# Smart-Projector
The Smart Projector using digital video processing is automated system embedded with various modes aimed at incorporating several digital processing techniques in common applications such as online classes especially during the times of a pandemic.  The project is a highlight on the research done at realizing the current hour problems faced and is directed to provide a real time intelligent solution yet based on minimal technology thus benefitting a large number of regular people such as teachers enabling them to improvise the quality of online education. The Smart Projector system makes use of the real time digital video processing techniques by taking an input of the slides to be presented by the user and the real time video capture and processes it frame by frame iteratively and identifies a region of colour space post conversion from RGB to HSV colour space and replaces the pixels of the slides with the identified region by use of contours. The Smart Projector is also enhanced with additional features like fixed display mode and moving display mode to enable quick presentation of slides without any repetitive switching and to allow hand detection and gestures inside the presented slides respectively. Therefore, the system not only allows an user to present slides by method of replacing pixels but also covers a wide range of needs of an user during an online presentation by the enhanced features provided with the system thus making an innovative and quality use of online education.
